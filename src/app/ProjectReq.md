  - Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** to ensure secure login sessions.

- **Pricing Plans:**
  - **Basic Plan:** Access to basic chatbot creation, limited integrations.
  - **Pro Plan:** Access to RAG-based chatbots, sentiment analysis, and multi-channel integrations.
  - **Enterprise Plan:** Unlimited bots, priority support, advanced analytics, and custom integrations.

### Implementation:
- Use a third-party authentication library (e.g., **Auth0** or **Firebase Authentication**).
- Set up a subscription-based model using **Stripe** or **PayPal** for payment processing.
- Restrict access to features based on the selected plan.

## **2. Bot Creation Process**

### Purpose:
Allow users to create and customize their chatbots, which will be powered by their uploaded knowledge base.

### Features:
- **Bot Name and Description:**
  - Users input a name and description for their chatbot.
  
- **Knowledge Base Setup:**
  - Users can connect their Google Sheets or upload files (PDF, Word) to serve as the knowledge base.
  - Implement file parsing using libraries like **PyPDF2** for PDFs and **python-docx** for Word files.

### Implementation:
- Use a user-friendly UI (built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**) to allow easy input of the bot’s name and description.
- Integrate **Google Sheets API** to fetch data from the connected Sheets.
- Process uploaded documents (PDF, Word) using Python-based libraries.

---

## **3. Knowledge Box & File Upload**

### Purpose:
Allow users to upload knowledge files and connect their Google Sheets to be used as the source of information for the chatbot.

### Features:
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface:**
  - Users can upload PDFs, Word documents, or drag-and-drop Google Sheets for easy integration.
  
- **Knowledge Box:**
  - After uploading files, the knowledge base will be displayed in a "Knowledge Box" for review.

### Implementation:
- Use **React Dropzone** for drag-and-drop functionality in **Next.js**.
- Implement backend services in **FastAPI** to process uploaded documents and parse them into usable formats (text).
- Show uploaded files in an interactive list format on the frontend.

## **4. RAG Model for Intelligent Responses**

### Purpose:
Utilize the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model to generate intelligent responses based on the knowledge base.

### Features:
- **Retrieve Knowledge:** 
  - RAG will retrieve relevant information from the uploaded files (PDF, Word, Google Sheets).
  
- **Generate Response:**
  - After retrieval, RAG uses a pre-trained model (e.g., **GPT** from **Hugging Face** or **T5**) to generate a contextual response.

- **Sentiment Analysis:**
  - Implement sentiment analysis (using models like **VADER** or **BERT**) to detect user emotion and adjust the bot’s tone (e.g., friendly, neutral, or empathetic).

### Implementation:
- Integrate **Hugging Face** Transformers for RAG and sentiment analysis models.
- Use the **retriever** to find relevant pieces of information from the knowledge base.
- Use **FastAPI** to manage communication between the frontend and AI models for response generation.

## **5. Bot Customization**

### Purpose:
Allow users to personalize the chatbot’s behavior, appearance, and tone of interaction.

### Features:
- **Appearance Customization:** 
  - Users can choose colors, fonts, and other UI elements for the chatbot.
  
- **Response Customization:** 
  - Predefined responses for specific scenarios (e.g., greeting, fallback message, etc.).
  
- **Conversation Flow Setup:** 
  - Users can define different paths for the bot (e.g., support, FAQ, product recommendations).

### Implementation:
- Use a visual customization interface with **Tailwind CSS** for easy styling adjustments.
- Allow users to input their own predefined responses or conversation flows.

---

## **6. Bot Deployment**

### Purpose:
Provide users with an easy way to deploy their chatbot on their website.

### Features:
- **Deployment Script Generation:**
  - After bot creation, users receive a JavaScript snippet to embed in their website.

### Implementation:
- Create an embedded JavaScript widget that can be integrated into any website’s HTML.
- Use **Node.js/Express** to serve the deployment script.

---

## **7. Feedback & Data Collection**

### Purpose:
Collect user feedback after interactions and track essential data points like customer queries, sentiment, and resolution status.

### Features:
- **User Feedback:**
  - After each interaction, prompt users to rate their experience (e.g., thumbs up/thumbs down or a 1-5 star system).

- **Data Collection:**
  - Track conversation logs, feedback, and sentiment analysis results.
  
### Implementation:
- Integrate a feedback collection mechanism in the chatbot UI (e.g., a thumbs up/down button).
- Store feedback and conversation logs in a **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL** database.

---

## **8. Analytics Dashboard**

### Purpose:
Provide insights into chatbot performance, user sentiment, and common customer queries.

### Features:
- **User Interaction Data:**
  - Display metrics like total number of chats, active users, response time, etc.

- **Sentiment Breakdown:**
  - Visualize sentiment analysis results (e.g., percentage of positive, negative, and neutral interactions).

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Show metrics like unresolved queries vs. successfully answered questions.

### Implementation:
- Create an interactive dashboard using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** for visualizations.

Sync chatbot conversation logs, user feedback, and performance data with Google Sheets for further analysis or reporting.

### Features:
- **Sync Logs and Feedback:**
  - Automatically push chatbot data (e.g., conversation logs, sentiment analysis, feedback) to a specified Google Sheet.

### Implementation:
- Integrate the **Google Sheets API** to push data to a user-specific sheet.
- Ensure data is organized into columns (e.g., Timestamp, User Query, Bot Response, Sentiment, etc.).
